# Global Electronics Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical sales data for a global electronics retailer to uncover insights into revenue performance, customer behavior, product trends, and regional sales distribution. SQL was used for data exploration and aggregation, while Power BI was used to build an interactive executive dashboard for decision-making.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate end-to-end analytics skills — from data cleaning and EDA in SQL to business-focused visualization in Power BI.
